# 2nd-Try At Coding

<p1>This is my first paragraph as I try to learn how to code and apply it on github. On of the main problems I have with coding is that I never found an application for it. I knew it was important, I just didn't know how to use it or where I should use it. Hopefully now with the discovery of Github I can start to apply my code, or at least in practice. </p1>

<p2> What happens if we add a second paragraph? </p2>
